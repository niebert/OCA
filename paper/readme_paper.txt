Paper and Use of Templates:
---------------------------
(1) Select a Document Format in which you want to write the paper:
- LibreOffice (OpenSource)
- LaTeX (OpenSource)
- Microsoft Word
Recommended to use OpenSource software. Furthermore if you use 
LibreOffice instead of Word if would solve formating problems. 

(2) Due to your selection copy one of the template folders (i.e. subdirectory
of "templates/" and copy that folder to "paper/"
rename the folder to <year><authorname><no>, so if you choose to write a
LaTeX paper, copy /templates/LaTeX to the folder "paper/" and 
rename "paper/LaTeX" to "paper/2016niehaus2"

(3) Finish your paper and create PDF 
- with PDF-Export in LibreOffice or 
- with "pdflatex"-Command of your LaTeX-installation


Presentation:
-------------
With the "presentation/" folder you can create a web based presentation, which 
can be used and downloaded via the github repository.
