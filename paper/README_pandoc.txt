Pandoc and Paper Template Generation
------------------------------------
Pandoc is a free and open-source software document converter, 
to create a wide variety of output formats with a single document.

The program is used by RStudio with knitr from a source file in Markdown 
to produce documents with an integrated statistical analysis of data.

In this OCA environment the Markdown Template is used to create 
different output templates in mainly in LibreOffice (ODT), LaTeX (tex) and MediaWiki.
Even MS-Word (doc) is possible, but the office software is commercial and 
does not supported all Operating Systems. Therefore (doc) is not a recommended 
format, especially because of formating problems across OpenSource operating systems.
